                    <h3>Wooden Spoons</h3>
                    <p>$25.00  </p>
                    <p> Wooden spoons have a low environmental impact due to their renewable material<br>, biodegradability, and lower energy consumption during production.<br> They decompose naturally, reducing landfill waste, and don't release harmful chemicals,<br> making them an eco-friendly alternative to plastic utensils </p>

                    <p>Eco-friendly bags reduce environmental impact compared to single-use plastic bags, but their sustainability varies<br>. Cotton bags, though biodegradable, require significant water and energy, needing many reuses to offset production costs.<br> Jute and recycled plastic bags have a lower impact, especially when reused frequently.<br> Biodegradable bags break down easier but may require specific conditions.   </p>

                    <h3>Bamboo Basket</h3>
                    <p>$39.99</p>
                    <p>Bamboo baskets have a relatively low environmental impact compared to plastic or metal alternatives. <br>Bamboo is a fast-growing, renewable resource that requires minimal water and no pesticides.<br> The production process for bamboo baskets is generally low-energy and often involves traditional handcrafting, reducing carbon emissions.<br> Additionally, bamboo is biodegradable, meaning bamboo baskets decompose naturally without leaving harmful residues. <br>However, the impact can vary based on the harvesting practices, transportation, and any treatments or chemicals used in the processing. Overall, they are considered an eco-friendly option.</p>

                    <h3>Fruit Basket</h3>
                    <p>$39.99</p>
                    <p>The environmental impact of a fruit basket depends on the materials used and the production process. <br>If the basket is made from sustainable materials like bamboo or recycled materials, its impact is relatively low. However, if it's made from plastic or non-sustainable resources,<br> it can contribute to pollution and waste. The environmental impact also includes factors like transportation and disposal.<br> Opting for baskets made from renewable or recycled materials helps minimize their environmental footprint.</p>

                    <h3>Wooden leafs</h3>
                    <p>$39.99</p>
                    <p>The environmental impact of wooden leaves, typically used for decor or art, depends on the source and processing of the wood. <br>If sourced from sustainably managed forests, wooden leaves can be eco-friendly, as wood is a renewable resource. The production process can be low-energy, especially if handcrafted.<br> However, if the wood comes from unsustainable logging practices, it can contribute to deforestation and habitat loss. <br>Wooden leaves are biodegradable, meaning they will decompose naturally over time, reducing waste. The overall impact is moderate to low, but sustainability practices are crucial to minimize negative effects.</p>
